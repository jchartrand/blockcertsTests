Some blockcerts.

A test blockcert that shows the degree as a single image (which is an exact copy of the PDF that generates the paper degree):

[Bachelor of Arts](signed-certs/SimonOakenfork.json)

You can import the file into a Blockcert Wallet or view and verify at [blockcerts.org](blockcerts.org).  First save the file somewhere -- on your phone for the Wallet, and on your computer for the web page -- and then import or upload respectively.

You can alternatively, and more simply, use this url to verify the cert (again at blockerts.org) or to import it into a Wallet:
